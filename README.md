# Formal Verification of ChaCha20-Poly1305 in openHiTLS
This is the source code repo for our project, which conducts the equvalence verfication of ChaCha20ï¼š
1) described in the standard (RFC 8439), and
2) implemented in the openHiTLS (v3.0.10).

This instruction describes the organization of the source code and how to use it.

## Software Requirements
- To run the RFC and openHiTLS Cryptol formal model of TLS 1.3 state machine you need [cryptol 3.1.0+](https://cryptol.net/).
- To verify equivalence between the openHiTLS formal model and the C code implementations, you need [SAW](https://saw.galois.com/).

## File Organization
**Source code files**:

- ChaCha20 Model, in the directory ``chacha20/``
  - ``chacha_combined.c``  : Defined the source code of ChaCha20 algorithm in openHiTLS
  - ``chacha_combined.bc`` : Compiled bytecode from openHiTLS ChaCha20 algorithm source code
  - ``chacha_openHiTLS.cry`` :  Defined the ChaCha20 Cryptol model based on OpneSSL source code
  - ``chacha_rfc.cry`` : Defined the ChaCha20 Cryptol model based on RFC standard document 
  - ``chacha.saw``: The script for verifying the equvalence between openHiTLS Cryptol models and ChaCha20 C code implementations
  - ``chacha_property.cry``: Proved the ChaCha20 equvalence and some security properties between the Cryptol model based on openHiTLS and the Cryptol model based on standard documentation


## The Execution of RFC Model Alone
You can use the following commands to run the RFC Cryptol model once in the console for revision and testing.

```
PROJECTROOTDIR> Cryptol
PROJECTROOTDIR> :l chacha_rfc.cry
encrypt: PROJECTROOTDIR> ChaCha20Encrypt k i n msg
```

## The Execution of openHiTLS Model Alone
You can use the following commands to run the openHiTLS Cryptol model once in the console for revision and testing.

```
PROJECTROOTDIR> Cryptol
PROJECTROOTDIR> :l chacha_openhitls.cry / :l chacha_block.cry 
encrypt: PROJECTROOTDIR> :l chacha_property.cry 
PROJECTROOTDIR> CHACHA20_ENC k i n msg
```

## The Execution of SAW
You can use the following commands to run the SAWScript to verify the equvalence between openHiTLS formal models and C code implementations, and output the results to the terminal.
```
PROJECTROOTDIR> saw [filename].saw
```
